The VM is running. To stop this VM, you can run `vagrant halt` to
shut it down forcefully, or you can run `vagrant suspend` to simply
suspend the virtual machine. In either case, to restart it again,
simply run `vagrant up`.

# ssh to the vm
vagrant ssh

C:\Users\lingx\OneDrive\Documents\shellscripting\testbox01>vagrant ssh
[vagrant@localhost ~]$

# Now you are connected to the Linux virtual machine as the vagrant user. The vagrant user has full sudo (administrative) privileges

# Exit the vm
[vagrant@localhost ~]$ exit

# run "vagrant halt" followed by "vagrant up" to activate any change from vagrantfile
vagrant halt

# or use "vagrant reload" to restart the vm and load the new configuration
vagrant reload
